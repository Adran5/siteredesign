This is the first assignment of our larger course project. 
You will put together a proposal for the responsive redesign of <http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu>.

    *   accessibility audit
    *   mobile friendliness
    *   performance (how quickly does it load?)
    *   functionality (does it work?)
    *   ease of use (is it pleasant to use?
*   user research (who are expected users? What do they want to accomplish?)
*   device support necessary
*   recommendations
    *   deliverables- each with description & acceptance terms

Use the tools and strategies we've learned so far to do this research. 
You will not be responsible for completing all of your recommendations for the redesign.
This will be a document to demonstrate your understanding of the domain.

*   done: Set up a Github repository and [Asana board for this project](https://app.asana.com/0/622197888656195/622197888656197). 
*   done: Create a ticket in Asana for this work item/assignment, with necessary details, steps, links to resources, etc.

We will be working on the same Github repository for this entire project, over several assignments.

done: Your proposal document should be uploaded to the Github repo, inside a "docs" directory. 
Submit a link to the repo.

## Week 2 Assignment: Initial reimplementation of top-level pages

From <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1188625/assignments/4210867?module_item_id=8367432>

*   Create an Asana ticket for this week's assignment.

*   Decide which pages of http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/ you want to rebuild. One should be the homepage, the others should be pages that are available from the top level navigation (like http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/energy-education/ or http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/public-outreach/). 

Chosen pages: Home, Public Outreach, Site Map.

*   Create html files in your final project repo, one for each page you'll build. Homepage should be named index.html. Each file needs a valid structure. Start building out the content in the body, as you see fit.

Initial stub pages uploaded/published: <https://mikeshhoffman.github.io/siteredesign/>

*   Add meta tags for rich social media sharing to the head of each file.

Done.

*   Publish the site to Github Pages. I know, it's not very impressive yet, but we want to get the live URL.

Done.

*   Using that live URL, generate share button for at least one social media platform (Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr). Insert the button in the body of index.html. It's ok if it's sort of randomly placed right now. After you build out the structure of the page more completely, you can move it. We just want it generated now so it's ready.

TBD

*   Submit a link to the live site for this assignment.

Will submit: <https://mikeshhoffman.github.io/siteredesign/>

Grading:
*   3 valid HTML files added to project repo     	 2
*   All necessary social media meta tags in head of each HTML file  	 3
*   At least one social media share button generated and used correctly  	 3
*   Some page content built out	 2
