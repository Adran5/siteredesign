# Design Plan for Redesigned Site

The overall spirit of the redesign is to do the opposite of the exiting site: instead, err on the side of simple plan low-key design.

As a tentative starting point, start with the least design possible, the most simple and generic -- as a corrective to the current site's complex design.

Since the Site Map is greatly improved as part of this redesign, the Site Map now effectively replaces the complex navigation, which currently has a top-level Nav Bar at top, and detailed Left-Side Nav Bar.


## Design Plan for Site's Colors

Add decorative imagery of white lightning on indigo deep blue-purple background. 

For solid background colors, such as Nav Bar and Footer, chose a muted equivalent of lightning-and-indigo: lightgoldenrodyellow (for the central article area) and pale blue-purple (#6FA2FF) for Nav Bar and Footer.


## Design Plan for Site's Typography

Use a body and heading typeface of Zilla%20Slab, which is semi-stylized, but is still readable and not overly distracting.


## Design Plan for Site's Layout

The redesign uses a simple vertical layout, without a left or right column:

*   The Logo is at very top.
*   The Nav Bar is at the top, and includes the Search feature without using vertical space.
*   The article (content pane) is in the middle.
*   The footer is at the bottom, containing social media sharing buttons and copyright notice.  

Omit the space-consuming universities' logos from the bottom of every page; they can move into a dedicated page.
The universities might want advertisement, such as the existing added 2 1/2" at the bottom of every page.
However, the site needs to focus on the content and devote space to the content, and use other ways of advertising the universities.

# Design-Components


## Design-Components: Logo (on every page)

Create a logo that is less tall, and have it at top of every page, consistently, so the nav bar remains in once place.

Do not repeat the logo on the home page as with the existing site.


## Design-Components: Navigation (on every page)

Per the theme and strategy of bare minimum design, omit the left-side navigation structure.


### Site Map Redesign

The existing site has 301 links in the Site Map.

Visually separate the top-level sitemap entries, such as bold with white space above.

Move the site map from the left-side nav column, into the main article area, eliminating the severe line-wrapping, for increased readability and less vertical scrolling.

Rather than a left-side nav bar, within the body of each main page that's listed in the Nav Bar, link to child pages.


### Site Map Reordering

First, list the main pages, which will be in the Nav Bar:
*   Home
*   About Us
*   Public Outreach: Fact Sheets, Videos, and Research Areas
*   Contact Us
*   FAQ
*   Links
*   Sitemap

A high-level linked outline will go here, listing only the following, top-level items (the parent groups of links).

Below the Nav Bar sitemap links, place all the parent (top-level) groups of links:
*   FESC Conferences
*   Zero Energy Demo Homes / Solar Decathlon Houses
*   FESC User Facilities (FL-CAN)
*   Florida Energy Facts
*   News Archive
*   FESC Expertise
*   FESC Funded Projects
*   Funding Opportunities (moved up)
*   FL University Research
*   Technology Commercialization
*   Facilities and Resources
*   Energy Industry
*   Energy Education/ Energy Jobs
*   Annual Reports, Publications, and Presentations


## Design-components Needed

*   Header, containing the top Nav Bar.

*   Article; the main, central part of each webpage, containing varying content.

*   Forms, such as "Sign up for the FESC Florida Energy Connections Newsletter" form.

*   Left and right sides.

*   Footer (on every page).


<!--=========================================================-->
# Visual Design Plan


## Visual Design Plan for Each Module/Design-component

*   Article; the main, central part of each webpage, containing varying content.
