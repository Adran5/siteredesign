# Design Plan for Redesigned Site

Design spirit overall: Decided to do the opposite of the exiting site: decided to err on the side of simple plan low-key design, like the good HBO GO site where a peer commented "What design? There's only content."

As a tentative starting point, start with the least design possible, the most simple and generic -- as a corrective to the current site's complex design.


## Design Plan for Site's Colors

Wanted a white lightning on indigo deep blue-purple background. For solid background colors, chose a muted equivalent, sand yellow and pale blue-purple.


## Design Plan for Site's Typography


Looked at the Google fonts catalog, decided against using a distracting, specialty-heading typeface.

Ended up with body and heading typeface of Zilla%20Slab. 


## Design Plan for Site's Layout

Logo at very top, Nav Bar at top, article (content pane) in middle, footer at bottom containing social media sharing buttons and copyright notice.  

Omit the universities' logos from the bottom of every page; they can move into a dedicated page.

## Design-Components: Logo (on every page)

Later, create a logo that is less tall, and have it at top of every page, consistently, so the nav bar remains in once place.

For now, have the existing logo at top of every page, above the nav bar.

Do not repeat the logo on the home page as with the existing site.


## Design-Components: Navigation (on every page)

Per the theme and strategy of bare minimum design, omit the left-side navigation structure.

### Site Map Redesign

The existing site has 301 links in the Site Map.

Visually separate the top-level sitemap entries, such as bold with white space above.

Move the site map from the left-side nav column, into the main article area, eliminating the severe line-wrapping, for increased readability and less vertical scrolling.

Rather than a left-side nav bar, within the body of each main page that's listed in the Nav Bar, link to child pages.


### Site Map Reordering

First, list the main pages, which will be in the Nav Bar:
*   Home
*   About Us
*   Public Outreach: Fact Sheets, Videos, and Research Areas
*   Contact Us
*   FAQ
*   Links
*   Sitemap

A high-level linked outline could go here, listing only the following, top-level items (the parent groups of links).

Below the Nav Bar sitemap links, place all the parent groups of links; eg:
*   FESC Conferences
*   Zero Energy Demo Homes / Solar Decathlon Houses
*   FESC User Facilities (FL-CAN)
*   FESC User Facilities (FL-CAN) #2
*   Florida Energy Facts
*   News Archive
*   News Archive #2
*   FESC Expertise
*   FESC Funded Projects
*   Funding Opportunities (moved up)
*   FL University Research
*   Technology Commercialization
*   Facilities and Resources
*   Energy Industry
*   Energy Education/ Energy Jobs
*   Annual Reports, Publications and Presentations


## Design-Components: Footer (on every page)

Footer at bottom containing social media sharing buttons and copyright notice.

Omit the universities' logos from the bottom of every page; they can move into a dedicated page.
